Sikuli Extension Guide
======================

this is the latest available version running with Sikuli X-1.0rc3+

Usage out of the box
--------------------

- download guide.jar
- in a script use

load("absolute-path-to-guide.jar")<br />
import guide

There is currently no actual documentation 
<br />(the chapter in the docs is outdated, since it is related to the version of Guide from the time of X-1.0rc2).

For information about features and their usage have a look into **guide.py** here https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliGuide2012/blob/master/src/guide/guide.py.

Working with the sources
------------------------

Feel free to make any changes to the sources.

Setup a java project in Netbeans or Eclipse using the src directory structure from this repo.

The libraries needed to setup a useable guide.jar can be found in the folder lib. <br />Additionally you need a valid library link to sikuli-script.jar.
